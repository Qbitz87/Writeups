## Description
```
To assist @nordbo with his graphical workload, we've developed an amazing image converter that allows the upload of images to be converted.

However, I think we made a mistake by uploading a image file with a secret message in it. Can you locate it?

### Challenge Description

This beginner-level challenge was straightforward, requiring us to identify an image containing a hidden message. We were provided a link to a webpage with an image upload feature, hinting at a potential mistake in an uploaded file that held a secret message.

### Solution Walkthrough

1. **Exploring the Upload Interface**:
   - Upon accessing the provided link, we found a simple interface that allowed users to upload an image file for conversion. We followed the instructions and uploaded an image, then pressed "Convert."
